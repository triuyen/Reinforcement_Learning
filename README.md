# Reinforcement_Learning
testing multiple algorithms in different environment

Test Monte Carlo on policy on the Game Line World : 

- Added ModelFreeLineWorld struct to define the grid-like environment.
- Implemented methods for agent movement, scoring, and state management.
- Developed MonteCarloAgent struct with epsilon-greedy policy and Q-value updates.
- Included example usage to demonstrate functionality.
