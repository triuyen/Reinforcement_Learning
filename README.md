# Reinforcement_Learning
testing multiple algorithms in different environment

## Algorithms :
### Monte Carlo On-Policy :

Things in main.rs file : 
    - Added LineWorld struct to define the grid-like environment.
    - Implemented methods for agent movement, scoring, and state management.
    - Developed MonteCarloAgent struct with epsilon-greedy policy and Q-value updates.
    - Included example usage to demonstrate functionality. 

## Enviorements:
### LineWorld:
                    _ _ _ _X_ _ _
    LineWorld is a simple grid-like environment 
    where an agent can move left or right along a line of cells. 
    The objective of the game is to navigate the agent from the starting position 
    toward one of the terminal states while maximizing the score.
